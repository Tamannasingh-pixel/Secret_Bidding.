# Secret_Bidding.

This repository contains a simple secret bidding program implemented in Python. The program allows multiple users to enter their bids without revealing them to others until the end, determining the winner based on the highest bid.

## Description

This program simulates a secret auction where multiple participants can submit their bids. Each participant enters their name and bid amount, which are stored securely. Once all participants have submitted their bids, the program reveals the winner â€“ the participant with the highest bid.

The program is implemented using Python dictionaries to store participant information and utilizes if statements, functions, and loops to manage the bidding process and determine the winner.

## Features

* Simple, text-based interface.
* Secure storage of bid information.
* Determines the winner based on the highest bid.
* Handles multiple bidders.
* Clear and concise code structure.

## May the Highest Bidder Win!
